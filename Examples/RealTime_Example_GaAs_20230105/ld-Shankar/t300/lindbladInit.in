# note that parameters scissor and onlyElec are not included in original version
# so that they must be commented out for original ePhSpinRelax

# scissor will change the energy of CBM

# in many cases, including both valence and conduction bands make the simulation very hard to converge
# I strongly suggest you to modify the code to add the option including only valence/conduction bands or controlling the band range

onlyElec	1 # considering only conduction bands
scissor         0.424240 # in unit eV, CBM energy will be added by this value
#Bext		0.1,0,0  # magnetic filed vector in Tesla
#EzExt		0  # For 2D systems, electric field along z direction in V/nm
		   # help to identify VBM and CBM if system has tiny band gap
