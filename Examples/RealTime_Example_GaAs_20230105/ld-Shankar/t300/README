lindblad initialization is done in this directory
spectrum mode simulation is done in sub-directory "spectrum"
real-time dynamics is done in sub-directory "rt-linear"


The initialization code is modified so that
if input paramter "onlyElec" is 1, only conduction bands will be considered

The resulting spin lifetime due to only e-ph by Shankar's lindblad code
is ~33 ps at 300 K, similar to that obtained by DMD code
